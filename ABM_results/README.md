# ICU_capacity_modelling_ABM
An Agent-Based Model for Intensive Care Unit capacity modelling at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center

This section contains 2 notebooks:

ABM_simulations_vF.ipynb in which we define our Agent Based Model and run simulations to ascertain the number of beds required to meet Hospital demand for the whole hospital and individual ICUs, during normal scenarios and during other 'realistic' scenarios.

ABM_graphs.ipynb in which we plot the results of these simulations graphically.
