# ICU Length of Stay Prediction
A key characteristic of each patient is their ICU length of stay (LOS). It is combined with patient admissions and the probability of developing sepsis to simulate patient flow. 

We use a machine learning approach and explore patient-clustering methods to effectively capture sub- population dynamics in patient outflow.
